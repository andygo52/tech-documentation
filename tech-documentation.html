       <p>Having completed the coding exercises for HTML and CSS at freeCodeCamp.org, the purpose of this technical documentation now is to provide a sandbox for creative explorations with the code I have learned so far.  Doing this in the form of a project gives me the chance to revisit the code and discover what proves useful in the shaping of this project.  It's also a chance for me to summarize and reflect my current understanding.</p>

       About the Coder</header>
       <p>My name is Andy Goldstein.  Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I studied journalism at Northwestern University.  During an internship at the Louisville Times, I became friends with Mike Covington, an artist who created illustrations for the Louisville Times, and that was the start of my lifelong love of art.  I studied art at Northwestern University under Ed Paschke, one of the leaders of the the Chicago Imagist movement.  I also studied at the University of Louisville, the New York Academy of Art and earned a Master of Fine Arts Degree from the Graduate School of Figurative Art of the New York Academy of Art.  After art school I painted at the Artist's Co-op in Delray, FL and exhibited at the Art of Africa in Delray, FL. </p>
       
 <p>Eventually, I became interested in teaching and earned my teaching degree from Florida Atlantic University.  I've been teaching ever since.  I currently teach a course in <i>Fundamentals of Web and Software Development</i> and <i>ICT Essentials.</i> You can view our class blog, which showcases my students' creative work at 
<a href="http://weblogs.pbspaces.com/mrgoldstein/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline"><i>Imagine</i></a>, and our class website, 
<a href="http://schools.firn.edu/websites/palm_beach/omni_middle_school/classrooms/andrew_goldstein/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline"><i>OmniVision</i></a>.  I've also taught Yearbook, having earned the Walsworth publisher's award (awarded to its top 5 percent of yearbooks in the country) three years in a row.  You can view our <a href="http://weblogs.pbspaces.com/mrgoldstein/yearbook/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">yearbook covers</a>, designed by students, handrawn, or designed in Flash or Photoshop.  We used Adobe InDesign to layout the pages of the yearbook.  I've also taught robotics, structures, PowerPoint, animation with Flash, stop-motion animation on iMac computers, creating ClayMation. I've taught game programming in Scratch and in Flash, and video production using iMovie and GarageBand on iMac computers. I teach web development using <i>Khan Academy</i>, <i>Code.org</i>, <i>Notepad++</i> and working with Dreamweaver to post our students' web pages to our class website.  In 2012, I was named one of four "Innovator Educators of the Year" in a county-wide competition sponsored by the School District of Palm Beach County and Microsoft.  I earned a trip to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington and showcased our students' work for our project, <i>Invent</i>.  I was one of 72 Regional winners that year for <a href="http://weblogs.pbspaces.com/mrgoldstein/2012/08/07/microsoft-partners-in-learning-u-s-forum-2012/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Microsoft Partners in Learning U.S. Forum 2012</i></a> (Scroll down to Andy Goldstein in Florida). </p>

       <p>For reference, for learning, I am using freeCodeCamp.org's section on Responsive Web Design Certification, which includes the following sections:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML 5</li>
            <li>Basic CSS</li>
            <li>Applied Visual Design</li>
            <li>Applied Accessibility</li>
            <li>Responsive Web Design Principles</li>
            <li>CSS Flexbox</li>
            <li>CSS Grid</li>
            <li>Responsive Web Design Projects</li>
       </ul>
       <p>I have completed all the exercises in the above sections, other than "Responsive Web Design Projects," which I am working on creating now.</p>
       <p>I have also studied Khan Academy's <i>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Web Pages</i> course, completing all the exercises.  These are:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Intro to HTML</li>
            <li>Intro to CSS</li>
            <li>More HTML tags</li>
            <li>CSS text properties</li>
            <li>Web development tools</li>
            <li>CSS layout</li>
            <li>More CSS selectors</li>
            <li>Other ways to embed CSS</li>
           <li>Further Learning</li>
           
       </ul>
       <p> I have also worked with Code.org's <i>Web Development Unit:</i></p>
       <h4>Web Content  and HTML</h4>
          <ul>
          
           <li>Exploring Websites</li>
            <li>Websites for Expression</li>
            <li>Intro to HTML</li>
            <li>Headings</li>
            <li>Digital Footprint</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Intellectual Property and Images</li>
            <li>Clean code and debugging</li>
           <li>Project - Multi-Page Websites</li>
            
           
       </ul>
       <h4>Styling and CSS</h4>
        <ul>
          
           <li>Styling Text with CSS</li>
            <li>Styling Elements with CSS</li>
            <li>Sources and Search Engines</li>
            <li>RGB Colors and Classes</li>
            <li>Project - Personal Portfolio Website</li>
                    
           
       </ul>
       
       
       
       <p> In addition, I am using a book for reference, <i>New Perspectives on HTML 5 and CSS3, 7th Edition Comprehensive</i> by Patrick Carey, published by Cengage Learning.  There's a lot of information packed into this book, and I think going through the exercises on freeCodeCamp.org has helped me understand the book better.</p>

         <p>I'm working on this project using <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline"><i>CodePen</i></a>.  I started this project with the free version of <i>CodePen</i>, then switched to <i>CodePen Pro</i> because I wanted to embed editable pens.  I  like the ability to style the embedded pen, rather than always having the same colors (black, white and gray).  I love the ability to work simultaneously in four windows at once (HTML, CSS, JS ((which I haven't yet started in freeCodeCamp) and the resulting web page that updates instantly as you code.  Very nice!  I also use Visual Studio Code, and in my classes, we use <i>Notepad++</i> and I use <i>Dreamweaver</i> to post student work and update links as the site gets worked and re-worked. We also use online coding platforms on <i>Khan Academy</i> and <i>Code.org</i>    </p>

    <p>   [I'm creating this in CodePen and I am working on figuring out how to insert images.  I tried uploading a screenshot of my code to my Google Drive, but I was out of storage, so I upgraded the plan from 15 GB to 100 GB.  But it takes up to 24 hours to take effect.  Plus, I'm not yet 100 percent sure that that will even work.  We'll find out tomorrow.  Anyway, I need to get some sleep.]</p>
